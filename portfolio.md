# NinjaMonitor - Distributed Trading System

## Project Overview
NinjaMonitor is a high-performance, distributed trading monitoring system that bridges NinjaTrader 8 with cloud-based web dashboards. Built to handle high-volume trading environments with enterprise-grade stability and scalability.

## Technical Architecture
- **Backend**: Go microservices architecture with WebSocket communication
- **Frontend**: Real-time web dashboard with Server-Sent Events
- **Integration**: C# NinjaTrader 8 AddOn for seamless trading platform integration
- **Deployment**: Cloud-native design supporting Google Cloud Run, Vercel, and other platforms

## Key Technical Achievements

### Performance & Stability
- **Race Condition Resolution**: Implemented mutex-protected concurrent map operations preventing system crashes during high-frequency trading events
- **Throttling Mechanism**: Advanced Task.Delay-based throttling replacing unstable Timer patterns, handling hundreds of updates per second
- **Connection Resilience**: Exponential backoff WebSocket reconnection with circuit breaker patterns

### Distributed System Design
- **Cloud-Local Bridge**: Secure local connection server maintaining NinjaTrader isolation while enabling cloud deployment
- **Command Relay System**: Bidirectional command processing with acknowledgment and retry mechanisms
- **Multi-Client Support**: Concurrent WebSocket connection handling with per-client goroutines

### Real-Time Features
- **Live Trading Data**: Sub-second position, order, and P&L updates across multiple accounts
- **Emergency Controls**: One-click position flattening and order cancellation with confirmation safeguards
- **WebSocket Communication**: Persistent bidirectional data flow between local trading systems and cloud dashboard

## Technical Stack
- **Languages**: Go, C#, JavaScript
- **Protocols**: HTTP/HTTPS, WebSocket, Server-Sent Events
- **Frameworks**: Gorilla WebSocket, NinjaTrader 8 API
- **Infrastructure**: Docker-ready, cloud-deployable architecture
- **Security**: Local command execution with cloud dashboard isolation

## Business Value
- **Risk Management**: Real-time position monitoring with emergency controls
- **Scalability**: Cloud deployment supporting multiple trading accounts and users  
- **Reliability**: Enterprise-grade stability fixes preventing system crashes during market volatility
- **Accessibility**: Remote trading monitoring from any device with web browser

## Development Highlights
- Identified and resolved critical race conditions in concurrent systems
- Designed fault-tolerant WebSocket communication patterns
- Implemented secure cloud-to-local command relay architecture
- Created comprehensive testing framework for distributed system validation
